"""Canonical, cryptographically-verified caller identity.

This module is the single source of truth for *who the caller is*. It replaces
the previous practice of trusting client-settable plaintext identity headers. In
a deployed environment the only identity source is the IAP-signed assertion
``X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion``, whose signature, issuer, audience and expiry are
verified before any claim is trusted.

Consumed by the request middleware (``main.py:set_request_context``) and, in a
later phase, by the Mesop ``AppState``. Vuln #2's server-side ownership checks
compare stored attribution against the identity produced here.

Design: ``.design`` / vuln-response ``vuln4-design.md`` (sections 3.2-3.5).
