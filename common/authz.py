"""Server-side ownership authorization for Firestore mutations.

This module centralizes the *server-side* authorization that every Firestore
mutate/delete path must perform before writing or deleting a document. It closes
the "broken access control" gap where the only ownership gate lived in
client/UI state (for example ``is_editable`` computed in a page render or the
``mode`` of a dialog), which a caller who reaches the mutation can bypass.

Trust model
-----------
The *caller identity* used here is the **server-derived, cryptographically
verified** user email. It is established server-side by
``common.verified_identity.get_verified_user_identity`` (which verifies the IAP
JWT assertion) in the request middleware and stored on
``state.state.AppState.user_email``. It is deliberately **not** re-read from any
client-controllable component state (``PageState``, dialog ``mode``, etc.) nor
from any plaintext identity header.

This ownership check enforces authorization on the server before every mutation;
Vuln #4 makes the identity it consumes unspoofable (the IAP assertion is verified
and plaintext identity headers are never trusted).
