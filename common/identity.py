"""Identity helpers: email normalization and the fail-closed auth policy.

Caller identity is derived exclusively from the cryptographically verified source
in :mod:`common.verified_identity`. This module intentionally no longer reads any
plaintext identity header: the prior header-fallback reader (the Vuln #4 spoofing
vector) has been removed. What remains is provider-agnostic email normalization,
shared constants, and the ``REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATED_USER`` policy resolution.

# --- Internal ASGI->WSGI identity transport (Vuln #4) ---------------------- #
# The verified caller identity is resolved in the ASGI request middleware, but
# the Mesop ``AppState`` runs in the WSGI app mounted behind ``WSGIMiddleware``.
# ``build_environ`` copies ONLY request headers (not custom ASGI scope keys) into
# the WSGI environ, so the middleware transports the ALREADY-verified values
# across the boundary as dedicated *internal* request headers. It sets them only
# after UNCONDITIONALLY stripping any client-supplied copy, so a client can never
# inject or append to them. These headers are NEVER an identity *input* to the
# verifier (see ``common.verified_identity``); they only carry a server-decided
# value from the middleware to ``AppState``.
