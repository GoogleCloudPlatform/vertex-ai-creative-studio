# gke-cluster module: a fresh Autopilot, regional GKE cluster with Workload
# Identity enabled. This is the GKE analogue of the compute substrate the
# cloud-run-service module provides for the Cloud Run path; it owns exactly one
# resource (the cluster) and provisions no data-bearing state.
#
# Autopilot manages nodes, so there is intentionally NO google_container_node_pool
# here (design.md's Standard-path node-pool language is overridden by the locked
# Autopilot decision). deletion_protection is on the CLUSTER only (default false so
# a non-prod cluster can be torn down cleanly) and is never applied to any data
# resource. The cluster depends on container.googleapis.com being enabled; the
# root wires that ordering by passing the project-services `apis_ready` handle
# through var.apis_ready_dependency (same pattern the Cloud Run root uses).
