## GenMedia Creative Studio

> **Browser Compatibility:** For the best experience, we recommend using Google Chrome. Some features may not work as expected on other browsers, such as Safari or Firefox.

GenMedia Creative Studio is a web application showcasing Google Cloud's generative media - Veo, Lyria, Chirp, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Generation (nano-banana), and Gemini TTS along with custom workflows and techniques for creative exploration and inspiration. We're looking forward to see what you create!

Current featureset

- Image: Gemini 3.1 Flash Image Generation (Nano Banana 2), Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro), Imagen 3, Imagen 4, Virtual Try-On
- Video: Veo 3.1, Veo 3, Veo 2
- Music: Lyria
- Speech: Chirp 3 HD, Gemini Text to Speech
- Workflows: Character Consistency, Shop the Look, Starter Pack Moodboard, Interior Designer
- Asset Library

This is built using [Mesop](https://mesop-dev.github.io/mesop/), an open source Python framework used at Google for rapid AI app development, and the [scaffold for Studio style apps](https://github.com/ghchinoy/studio-scaffold).

## Experiments

The [Experimental folder](./experiments/) contains a variety of stand-alone applications and new and upcoming features that showcase cutting-edge capabilities with generative AI.

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find:

**MCP Tools**

- **MCP Tools for Genmedia:** Model Context Protocol servers for Veo, Imagen, Lyria, Chirp, and Gemini to bring creativity to your agents.
  - ⚡ **Instant Installation:** You can now install all MCP servers directly using our pre-compiled binaries:
    ```bash
    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia/mcp-genmedia-go/install-online.sh | bash
    ```

**Combined Workflows**

- **Countdown Workflow:** An automated two-stage pipeline to create branded countdown videos.
- **Storycraft:** An AI-powered video storyboard generation platform that transforms text descriptions into complete video narratives.
    - **Creative GenMedia Workflow:** An end-to-end workflow to produce high-quality, on-brand creative media.
    - **Run, Veo, Run:** A real-time, multimodal video generation experiment that creates a branching narrative loop using Veo 3.1 for video extension and Gemini 3 for context awareness.

**Prompting Techniques**

- **Promptlandia:** A powerful web app to analyze, refine, and improve your prompts.
- **Veo Genetic Prompt Optimizer:** An automated system to evolve and refine high-level "metaprompts" for Veo.
- **Character & Item Consistency:** Workflows for maintaining consistency for characters and items across video scenes.

**Image Generation & Analysis**

- **Virtual Try-On:** A notebook for virtually trying on outfits at scale.
- **Imagen Product Recontextualization:** Tools for large-scale product image recontextualization.
- **Arena:** A visual arena for rating and comparing images from different models.

**Audio & Video**

- **Creative Podcast Assistant:** A notebook for creating a podcast with generative media.
- **Babel:** An experimental app for Chirp 3 HD voices.

...and much more! For a full, detailed list of all experiments, please see the [Experiments README](./experiments/README.md).
